title: snabbdom
---

A virtual DOM library with focus on simplicity, modularity, powerful features and performance.

## Introduction

Virtual DOM is awesome. It allows us to express our application's view
as a function of its state. But existing solutions were way way too
bloated, too slow, lacked features, had an API biased towards OOP
and/or lacked features I needed.

Snabbdom consists of an extremely simple, performant and extensible
core that is only ≈ 200 SLOC. It offers a modular architecture with
rich functionality for extensions through custom modules. To keep the
core simple, all non-essential functionality is delegated to modules.

You can mold Snabbdom into whatever you desire! Pick, choose and
customize the functionality you want. Alternatively you can just use
the default extensions and get a virtual DOM library with high
performance, small size and all the features listed below.
